About Me
( Do not include birthdate / age / contact information)
  
  Education / Achievements:My achievement is that I will continue to be part of it with honors until college. I was also promoted as an executive director for APC-MSC, where I led a team of dedicated individuals in achieving our goals and making a positive impact in our organization. In college, I plan to further hone my leadership skills and continue to strive for excellence in everything I do. My ultimate goal is to make a difference in the world and inspire others to do the same.
  
  Course: BSIT
  
  IT Experience:When I was in my first year, I experienced coding using Java and Python. I learned some basic tools by using a computer, although I already experienced that when I was in high school, but my knowledge is still limited at that time. As I continued my studies, I delved deeper into different programming languages and gained a better understanding of software development. This foundational experience in coding opened up new opportunities for me and sparked my interest in pursuing a career in technology. 
  
  Hobbies & Interests: I love reading books, explore more about technology, doing sports, all engaging things to do.
  
  Goals In Life / Dream: My dream is to pursue an IT degree and start my own tech company in the future, using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives, with the hope of achieving personal success and societal advancement.
